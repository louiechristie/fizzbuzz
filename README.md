# Time taken

Time taken to do this Test Driven Development (TDD) style:

- 24 Nov 2025 ~3 hours.
  Expectation in a job interview (by most senior devs who don't use TDD)
- < 5 minutes

However, this is maintainable code that is refactorable with a high level of confidence.

Could I do this in TDD style in < 5 mins with repeating/practicing the Kata? Should I try?
