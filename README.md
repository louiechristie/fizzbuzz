# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz code Kata, see <https://www.codurance.com/katas/fizzbuzz>

Experiment with new 2025 technology:

- Running TypeScript Natively - available in node since v22.18.0 on Jul 31, 2025 [(v22.18.0 release notes)](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v22.18.0)
- [node test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html#test-runner) available in node since v18.0.0 on 19 Apr 2022 [(v18.0.0 release notes)](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v18.0.0)

# Time taken

Time taken to do this Test Driven Development (TDD) style:

- 24 Nov 2025 ~3 hours.
  Expectation in a job interview (by most senior devs who don't use TDD)
- < 5 minutes

However, this maintainable code, refactorable with a high level of confidence.

Could I do this in TDD style in < 5 mins with repeating/practicing the Kata? Should I try?
